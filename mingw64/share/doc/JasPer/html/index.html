Introduction</h1>
<p>JasPer is a collection of software (i.e., a library and application programs) for the coding and manipulation of images. This software can handle image data in a variety of formats. One such format supported by JasPer is the JPEG-2000 format defined in ISO/IEC 15444-1. This software was developed by <a href="https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams">Michael Adams</a> from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.</p>

===================

* Test release performed with GitHub Actions.

2.0.29 (2021-04-16)
===================

===================

* Fix potential null pointer dereference in the JP2/JPC decoder. (#269)

* Fix integral type sizing problem in JP2 codec. (#284)

2.0.27 (2021-03-18)
===================

* Check for an image containing no samples in the PGX
  decoder. (#271, #272, #273, #274, #275, #276, #281)
* Check for dimensions of zero in the JPC and JPEG decoders.
* Fix an arguably incorrect type for an integer literal
  in the PGX decoder. (#270)
* Check for an invalid component reference in the
  JP2 decoder. (#269)
* Check on integer size in JP2 decoder. (#278)

2.0.26 (2021-03-05)
===================

* Fix JP2 decoder bug that can cause a null pointer dereference for
  some invalid CDEF boxes. (#268)

2.0.25 (2021-02-07)
===================

* Fix memory-related bugs in the JPEG-2000 codec resulting from
  attempting to decode invalid code streams. (#264, #265)
  This fix is associated with CVE-2021-26926 and CVE-2021-26927.
* Fix wrong return value under some compilers (#260)
* Fix CVE-2021-3272 heap buffer overflow in jp2_decode (#259) 

2.0.24 (2021-01-03)
===================

* Add JAS_VERSION_MAJOR, JAS_VERSION_MINOR, JAS_VERSION_PATCH
  for easier access to the JasPer version.
* Fixes stack overflow bug on Windows, where variable-length
  arrays are not available. (#256)

2.0.23 (2020-12-08)

  https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/252

2.0.22 (2020-10-05)
===================

* Update manual

* Remove JPEG dummy codec. Jasper needs libjpeg for JPEG support

* New option -DJAS_ENABLE_HIDDEN=true to not export internal symbols in the public symbol table

* Fix various memory leaks

* Plenty of code cleanups, and performance improvements

* Some macros were changed to inline functions.  This has to potential to
  impact some code that made assumptions about the implementation.  Some
  potentially impacted macros include:
      jas_matrix_numrows, jas_matrix_numcols
      jas_matrix_get
      jas_seq_get, jas_seq_start, jas_seq_end
      jpc_ms_gettype
      jas_matrix_set and jas_seq_set is affected differently; the old macro was
      an actual expression returning the value, while the new function does not.
  The following macros have been changed, too, but are likely not
  affected, since they have been an rvalue-expression anyway:
      JP2_DTYPETOBPC, JP2_BPCTODTYPE
      JAS_IMAGE_CDT_{SETSGND,GETSGND,SETPREC,GETPREC}
      jas_image_cmptdtype
      macros from here
      jas_matrix_setv, jas_matrix_getvref
      jas_matrix_bind{row,col}
      the jpc_fix_ family
      the JPC_QCX and JPC_COX families
